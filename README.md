## DEPRECATED

Source code moved to the [new GitHub repo](https://github.com/tripolskypetr/material-ui-umd/tree/master/packages/yolo-mark-pwa)

## Browser support, development reason

Wrote for *Desktop Chrome 83*, but it look's like works in *Desktop Firefox 77* too. *Desktop Safari 12.1.1 on Mac OS 10.14.5* works like a charm. It wood be great to test on iPad mobile safari.
